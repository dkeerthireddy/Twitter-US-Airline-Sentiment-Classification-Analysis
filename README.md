# Twitter-US-Airline-Sentiment-Classification-Analysis
#### Inititally, I analysed  the Twitter US Airline data using various plots. After better visualization, I understood that the Neutral sentiment provided in the dataset is hindering the accuracy of the classification models being used. Thus, I used only the Positive and Negative sentiments for the classification models. In this project, I used different classification algorithms, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Matrix(SVM), and Random Forest. I also used Logistic Regression. VADER was also used on the dataset with three sentiments (Positive, Negative and Neutral). I also  analysed the f1-score and also the accuracy of the test set data using the classification models.
